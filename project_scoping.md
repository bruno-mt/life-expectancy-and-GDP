# Project Scoping

*Made with the help of Carnegie Mellon University's [Data Science Project Scoping Guide](https://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/our-work/tools-guides/data-science-project-scoping-guide/)*

The scoping process is fairly iterative and the scope gets refined both during the scoping process as well as during the project.

## 0. Problem Understanding
*What is the problem? Who does it impact and how much? How is it being solved today and what are some of the gaps?*

>Life Expectancy and GDP relationship. 

>We are trying to understand if/how these metrics are related for different countries.

*Definitions*

**Life Expectancy:** The average number of years that a newborn could expect to live, if he or she were to pass through life exposed to the sex- and age-specific death rates prevailing at the time of his or her birth, for a specific year, in a given country, territory, or geographic area.

**GDP:** Gross Domestic Product is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.


## 1. Goals***
*What are the goals of the project? How will we know if our project is successful?*

Identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

Would an increase in GDP also increase the life expectancy? 

Does the proportion between these metrics is similar for every country?

> To find if it's possible and viable/positive to have growth in both GDP and Life Expectancy and how.


## 2. Actions
*What actions or interventions will this work inform?*

*What actions can the organization take to achieve these goals?*

*How can we inform those actions to make them more effective?*

*These actions often need to be fairly concrete: home inspections, enrolling a student in one of three after-school programs, targeted emails for fundraising or advocacy, dispatching an emergency vehicle, or scheduling a waste pickup.*

Here I would list actions that the organization is already implementing in order to achieve the desired goals. Maybe I can search for something about GDP and Life Expectancy.

This Analysis would then provide data that helps improve/replace (and explain why) said actions.


## 3. Data***
*What data do you have access to internally? What data do you need?
What can you augment from external and/or public sources?*

For this project I was given a dataset containing the GDP and Life Expectancy from 6 countries. I haven't analyzed it yet, so I'm not sure if there's any more information in there.

This whole project began based off of the dataset, and normally it should be the other way around: there's a problem, define it, have goals AND THEN find the data that can help you solve it.

It's important to keep that in mind.

## 4. Analysis***
*What analysis needs to be done? Does it involve description, detection, prediction, or behavior change? How will the analysis be validated?*

> It is worth reiterating that analysis is not the goal of a data science project, and itâ€™s advisable to leave this piece aside until the goals, actions, and available data are clearly defined. 

There are 5 types of analysis:

(More info on each: https://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/our-work/tools-guides/data-science-project-scoping-guide)

1. **Description\***
2. **Detection**
3. **Prediction**
4. **Optimization\***
5. **Behavior Change**

For this project, we will be using **Descriptive Analysis** in order to understand the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy. Based on our results and how/if the goals evolve with the findings, we might also do something with **Optimization**.


## Summary

### Goals
Identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

Would an increase in GDP also increase the life expectancy?

Does the proportion between these metrics is similar for every country?

To find if it's possible and viable/positive to have growth in both GDP and Life Expectancy and how.

### Data

### Analysis
For this project, we will be using Descriptive Analysis in order to understand the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy. Based on our results and how/if the goals evolve with the findings, we might also do something with Optimization.
